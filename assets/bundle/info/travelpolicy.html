</span><span style='text-transform:none'>PURPOSE OF </span></a><span
style='text-transform:none'>POLICY</span></h1>

<p class=Paragraph>It is the purpose of this policy to provide employees with a
statement of Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. policies and procedures for the
expenditures and accounting of Company funds used for business-related travel
and entertainment.</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc358704608">2.0<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style='text-transform:none'>POLICY OBJECTIVE</span></a><span
style='text-transform:none'> </span></h1>

<p class=Paragraph>It is recognized that, for many employees, travel and
entertainment expenses are incurred in order to further business objectives.
The objective of this travel policy is to manage travel and entertainment costs
in a manner that ensures cost-effectiveness, traveler safety, and consideration
of traveler comfort.</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc358704609"><span style='text-transform:none'>3.0<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='text-transform:none'>SCOPE OF APPLICATION</span></a><span
style='text-transform:none'> </span></h1>

<p class=Paragraph><span style='letter-spacing:-.3pt'>This policy applies to
all employees of Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., its operations and its
subsidiaries</span>.</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc358704610">4.0<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style='text-transform:none'>POLICY</span></a></h1>

<p class=Paragraph>An employee traveling on Company business is expected to
exercise the same care in incurring expenses as a prudent person traveling for
personal reasons.  Travel on business should be conducted at minimum cost for
achieving the success of the mission. </p>

<p class=Paragraph>The need for standardization of both documentation and
application of such expenses and the increasing reporting requirements of the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service, similar taxing agencies of other countries and other
regulatory bodies dictate that all employees of the Company are guided by a
common set of expense policies. </p>

<p class=Paragraph>It is the responsibility of each employee incurring such
expenses and each supervisory person approving them to ensure that the policy
guidelines are followed.  Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. has implemented
exception reporting, which supports the travel policies, procedures and the
preferred supplier programs.  Exception reporting by employee may be forwarded
to the appropriate manager for review. </p>

<p class=Paragraph>All employees who travel for business or arrange travel are
expected to become acquainted with this policy as set forth herein. </p>

<h2 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc358704611">4.1<span

<p class=Paragraph><b>Use of Designated Travel Agencies</b> - Employees
traveling on Company business shall use the currently designated Travel Agency
or Online Booking Tool for their location for all business travel bookings.  BCD
Travel is the designated agency in the United States of America and Cliqbook is
the online booking tool.  For the most current country by country listing of
travel agencies and approved booking sources, please refer to JNET Travel pages
- Book Your Trip</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Employees will be kept notified of any changes in travel
agency designation. </p>

<p class=Paragraph><u>Use of Jacobs' Designated Travel Agencies ensures all
traveler data is transferred into Jacobs' ISOS Traveler Tracking Tool.</u></p>

<p class=Paragraph>If for any reason, a designated Travel Agency cannot be used
to make travel reservations, the employee is responsible for entering their complete
travel itinerary (air, car and hotel) into ISOSs Personal Travel Locator Tool,
which will transfer the data into our the ISOS Traveler Tracking program.  The
ISOS Personal Travel Locator can be found at <a
href="https://www.internationalsos.com/MasterPortal/default.aspx?membnum=11BCMA000069">https://www.internationalsos.com</a></p>

<p class=Paragraph><b>Cost Containment/Policy Adherence</b> - Managers are
responsible for evaluating all trips to determine if the trip is necessary and
cost effective.  For the purposes of this policy, the term &quot;manager&quot;
or &quot;management&quot; will mean the employees direct supervisor or
assigned project manager. </p>

<p class=Paragraph>Travel cost in connection with work under contract will be
charged to that job as a direct cost.  All other travel will be charged to
overhead.  Cost saving options as identified in this policy applies equally to
project and overhead paid travel. </p>

<p class=Paragraph>If a client has a more stringent travel policy than this
policy, the traveler should adhere to the client policy whenever possible. </p>

<p class=Paragraph>Non-compliance with this policy may result in disciplinary
action. </p>

<p class=Paragraph>Employees travel that will be charged direct to a project
must adhere to the terms and conditions of the governing contract.</p>

<p class=Paragraph><b>Travel Risk Planner (TRiP) and SPA's - </b>All travel
requires completion of an SPA via use of Jacobs' Travel Risk Planner tool (TRiP)
prior to trip commencement. TRiP is a web-enabled tool that provides the ability
to complete a travel SPA with the appropriate approvals based on the travel
risk ratings for the country you are visiting. Additionally, all international
travel requires prior approval from a Group or Senior Vice President.  <b>TRiP
can be accessed at http://trip.jacobs.com</b></p>

<h2 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc358704612">4.2<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style='text-transform:none'>AIR TRAVEL</span></a><span
style='text-transform:none'> </span></h2>

<p class=Paragraph><b>Two-Hour Window - </b>It is the obligation of each
employee to choose the least expensive flight including restricted fare
options, from all alternatives within two (2) hours of the originally intended
departure/arrival time. Within these parameters, any savings of $100.00 or less
per round trip may be declined for any reason without approval. </p>

<p class=Paragraph><b>Exception - </b>Savings greater than $100.00 per round
trip are designated as an exception.  All exceptions require written manager
approval.  If the manager approves an exception, a report with this approval may
be forwarded to senior management to review the savings forfeiture to the
Company. </p>

<p class=Paragraph><b>Connections/Alternate Airports - </b>While non-stop
flights are the prime objective, we expect travelers to accept one-stop or
connecting flights (within the two-hour window parameter) if savings of $300 or
greater per round trip are available.  Additionally, if alternate airports
within a reasonable proximity of the requested departure/arrival city and within
the 2 hour window parameter have a savings of $500 or greater round trip,
travelers should accept the alternate airport.  Managers will need to compare
employee travel savings versus additional travel time to determine if cost
savings should be forfeited. </p>

<p class=Paragraph><b>First Class/Business Class - </b>On international
flights, many airlines offer three classes of service, first class, business
class and coach.  Coach class is the least expensive and should normally be
used.  However, from time to time our clients will allow, and reimburse for
business or first class for international flights.  You must have prior
approval from a Group or Senior Vice President for first or business class
travel.  </p>

<p class=Paragraph><b><i>Upgrades - </i></b>Are authorized only when obtained
at no extra cost to the Company (i.e. a frequent flyer incentive offered by the
airlines). Charges associated with Early Bird Check-in/Business Select or other
airline perks are considered similar to upgrades and are not reimbursable.</p>

<p class=Paragraph><b>Frequent Flyer Points - </b>Travelers may retain frequent
flyer points and awards for personal use.  <b><u>Under no circumstances</u></b><u>
</u>should any employee cause the Company to pay a higher airfare in order to
fly on the carrier of his or her selection so that extra mileage credits and
awards can be accrued.  The same criteria apply to hotel and rental cars. </p>

<p class=Paragraph><b>Airline Transaction Fees -</b> Per our U.S. agreement
with BCD Travel, a transaction fee will be charged for each ticket generated. 
There may also be costs associated with voids, exchanges, refunds and lost
ticket transactions.  Plan ahead to avoid changes.  Agreements vary from
country to country, please refer to the contacts listed on JNET - Book Your
Trip for details.</p>

<p class=Paragraph><b>Unused Airline Tickets  </b>Unused airline tickets or
vouchers issued by our designated Travel Agencies must be returned immediately
for refunding and cancellation.  Unused tickets require notification by the
traveler to the Travel Agency so that the redemption or refund can be
obtained.  Do not exchange tickets at the airport unless the Travel Agency has
instructed you to do so.  Never destroy or throw away airline tickets, as these
are accountable documents. </p>

<p class=Paragraph style='page-break-after:avoid'><b>Electronic Ticketing </b>-The
preferred method of ticketing is electronic ticketing or
&quot;E-ticketing&quot;.  Tickets will be issued in this form unless prohibited
by the airline. </p>

<p class=Paragraph><b>Airport Purchases </b>- The purchase of airline tickets
at the airport is not authorized except in emergency situations.  Use your
countrys designated Travel Agency during business hours.  In the event of an
emergency after hours, you may call your Travel Agencys after hours service to
purchase new tickets or to make changes in route.  A fee will be charged for
each after hours call.   Refer to JNET - Book Your Trip for after hours contact
information. </p>

<p class=Paragraph><b>Charter Aircraft </b> Charter aircraft for Company
business travel must be approved in advance at the Group/Senior Vice President
level.  Use of personal aircraft for Company travel is prohibited. </p>

<p class=Paragraph><b>Company Paid Spouse/Domestic Partner/Family </b> Company
paid spouse/domestic partner/family travel must be authorized specifically on a
travel authorization in advance of the trip.  A copy of the travel
authorization must be included with the expense report before reimbursement can
be made. </p>

<p class=Paragraph><b>Airport Parking </b>- The most economical available
choice for airport parking is required.  When available, long-term parking
should be used for trips over 24 hours.  Cab/Shuttle services to/from the
airport should be utilized for extended travel when cost would be less than
airport parking costs. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. has
negotiated corporate rates with various individual properties and hotel chains,
and has given consideration to the class of hotel depending upon where an
employee is in the world.  </span>The most current version of Jacobs Preferred
Hotel Listing can be found on JNET - Book Your Trip</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>All Hotel reservations should be booked
through your countrys Designated Travel Agency or via Cliqbook and not the
hotel.    This allows Jacobs to track room nights for lower negotiated rates
based on volume.  <a name="OLE_LINK1">It also ensures hotel data is captured in
the ISOS Traveller Tracking tool.  Exceptions <u>must</u> be entered manually
in the Personal Travel Locator portal, located on ISOS's main page at </a><a

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>All personal valuables should be left at
home or stored in a hotel safe.  Neither Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. nor the
hotel is responsible for valuables left in your room. </span></p>

<p class=paragraph0><b>Hotel Guarantees/Cancellations - </b>All reservations
are guaranteed for late arrival. Guarantees will be applied to the travelers
corporate credit card.&nbsp; Employees should understand the hotels
cancellation policy and plan accordingly; hotel cancellation policies vary from
property to property.&nbsp; If a reservation needs to be cancelled the employee
is responsible for canceling it within the timeframe specified by that hotels
cancellation policy to avoid any no-show penalties.&nbsp; Employees must
contact the travel department or the hotel directly and obtain a cancellation
number as documentation of the transaction. </p>

<p class=Paragraph><b>Long term stays - </b>Prolonged stays of two weeks or
longer should be reviewed with your countrys designated Travel Agency with as
much advance notice as possible.  Volume discounts could possibly be negotiated.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Stays of 30 days or more might be made more economical by
utilizing Jacobs long-term housing partner, Oakwood Temporary Housing. 
Oakwood Temporary Housing provides Jacobs long-term housing solutions on a
global basis.  For more information, refer to our customized website at <a
href="http://www.oakwood.com/cms/extra_jacobs1">www.Oakwood.com</a>. </p>

<p class=Paragraph><b>Meeting Space - </b>All contracts associated with room
blocks, banquet facilities, etc. negotiated directly with a hotel must be
reviewed by your Legal Department prior to signing.  No exceptions.  Be aware
of the cancellation policy and any penalty fees associated with cancelling or
modifying your meeting.  No individual is permitted to use their personal
credit card for payment of a group or to collect loyalty points or mileage
related to group stays.  </p>

</span><span style='text-transform:none'>RENTAL CARS</span></a><span
style='text-transform:none'> </span></h2>

<p class=Paragraph>All rental cars should be reserved through your countrys
Designated Travel Agency. Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. has negotiated rates
with <b>HERTZ</b> as our primary preferred vendor.  Secondary preferred vendors
are <b>National Car Rental</b> and <b>Enterprise Rent-A-Car</b>. (Enterprise is
only contracted for use in the U. S., Puerto Rico and Canada). The Company
authorizes rentals of intermediate or compact class automobiles only. Full-size
rental cars are allowed when entertaining or transporting more than four
individuals and it is more economical for the Company. Any exception to these
requirements must be approved in advance by the manager.  </p>

<p class=Paragraph>It is against policy to rent vehicles under another company
or association name when traveling on Company business. </p>

<p class=Paragraph>The employee will need to meet the age and driving
requirements of the car rental company.  Fellow employees may legally drive the
car if these requirements are met.  This may vary by location.  Contact your
countrys Designated Travel Agency for details. </p>

<p class=Paragraph>To avoid inflated gasoline charges, always refuel your
vehicle before returning it to the rental location.  </p>

<p class=Paragraph>You are encouraged to rent GPS equipment only when the
complexity of your driving itinerary is such that this type of assistance is
required or driving conditions would be compromised without the provision of GPS.</p>

<p class=Paragraph><b>Loss Damage Waiver (LDW)</b> covers damages to the rental
vehicle, including theft, vandalism and collision.  Hertz, National and
Enterprise provide no-cost LDW to Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. travelers using
the Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. corporate agreement account number, and
renting at contracted rates.  LDW coverage for Hertz and National applies at

the mileage rate established by the Company or governing contract.  This
reimbursement is intended to cover all the costs associated with the operation
and maintenance of the vehicle including but not limited to gasoline, oil,
tires, damage to the vehicle, insurance and deductibles.  Employee owned

<p class=Paragraph>Regular travelers are to use Company provided American
Express credit cards for travel and apply for reimbursement upon returning from
their trip.  Failure to use the Company provided credit card might result in
delayed reimbursement.   Airfare may be expensed prior to travel to ensure the
employee is not burdened with outstanding charges prior to being reimbursed by
Jacobs.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>In the event an employee incurs a charge on their corporate
card that is pending refund, they will place those costs in dispute pending
receipt of a new statement.  If the charge remains open on a second statement,
employee will notify the Designated Travel Agency and Corporate Card Administrator
for resolution.  The Designated Travel Agency upon notification will process
all refunds by the traveler, and the Designated Travel Agency will confirm
refund initiation. </p>
